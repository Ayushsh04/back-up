    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Front End Engineering</h1>
    <p>The FEED is basic engineering, which comes after the Conceptual design or Feasibility study. The FEE design focuses the technical requirements as well as rough investment cost for the project. The FEED can be divided into separate packages covering different portions of the project. The FEED package is used as the basis for bidding the Execution Phase Contracts (EPC, EPCI, etc) and is used as the design basis.

        A good FEED will reflect all of the client's project-specific requirements and avoid significant changes during the execution phase. FEED contracts usually take around 1 year to complete for larger-sized projects. During the FEED phase, there is close communication between Project Owners and Operators and the Engineering Contractor to work up the project-specific requirements.
        
        Front-End Engineering focuses on technical requirements and identifying main costs for a proposed project.[2] It is used to establish a price for the execution phase of the project and evaluate potential risks. It is typically followed by Detailed Design (or Detailed Engineering). The amount of time invested in Front-End Engineering is higher than a traditional quote, because project specifications are thoroughly extracted, and the following typically developed in detail:
        
        Project Organization Chart
        Project Scope
        Defined civil, mechanical and chemical engineering
        HAZOP, safety and ergonomic studies
        2D & 3D preliminary models
        Equipment layout and installation plan
        Engineering design package development
        Major equipment list
        Automation strategy
        PFD – Process Flow Diagrams and P&ID – Piping and Instrumentation Diagram
        Project timeline
        Fixed-bid quote
        Traditionally, all of these documents would be developed in detail during a design review after a quote has been agreed to. A company using FEED will develop these materials before submitting a quote.
        
        Front-end engineering is typically used by design/build engineering firms. These firms may operate in various industries, including:
        
        Automation
        Process Industry
        Chemical processing
        Construction
        EPC
        EPCIC
        Equipment design
        Manufacturing
        Pharmaceuticals
        Petrochemicals
        Process system design
        Production line design</p>

            <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and layout web pages — for example, to alter the font, color, size, and spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other decorative features</p>

            <li><h3>JS-Java Script</h3></li>
            <p>JavaScript is a dynamic programming language that's used for web development, in web applications, for game development, and lots more. It allows you to implement dynamic features on web pages that cannot be done with only HTML and CSS.

                Many browsers use JavaScript as a scripting language for doing dynamic things on the web. Any time you see a click-to-show dropdown menu, extra content added to a page, and dynamically changing element colors on a page, to name a few features, you're seeing the effects of JavaScript.</p>
