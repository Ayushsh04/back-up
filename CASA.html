            A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers (or other mathematical objects), called the entries of the matrix. Matrices are subject to standard operations such as addition and multiplication.[2] Most commonly, a matrix over a field F is a rectangular array of elements of F.[3][4] A real matrix and a complex matrix are matrices whose entries are respectively real numbers or complex numbers.

        <p><h4>About Partial Differentiation</h4>
            In mathematics, a partial derivative of a function of several variables is its derivative with respect to one of those variables, with the others held constant (as opposed to the total derivative, in which all variables are allowed to vary). Partial derivatives are used in vector calculus and differential geometry.

            {\displaystyle {\tfrac {\partial z}{\partial x}}.} Since a partial derivative generally has the same arguments as the original function, its functional dependence is sometimes explicitly signified by the notation, such as in:
            
            �
            �
            ′
            (

            ,
            �
            ,
            …
            )
            ,
            ∂

            ∂

            (
            �
            ,
            �
            ,
            …
            )
            .
            {\displaystyle f'_{x}(x,y,\ldots ),{\frac {\partial f}{\partial x}}(x,y,\ldots ).}
            The symbol used to denote partial derivatives is ∂. One of the first known uses of this symbol in mathematics is by Marquis de Condorcet from 1770,[1] who used it for partial differences. The modern partial derivative notation was created by Adrien-Marie Legendre (1786), although he later abandoned it; Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi reintroduced the symbol in 1841.[2</p>
